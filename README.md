# Configs

One of my biggest annoyances with working on a new server, is that I don't have any of my usual aliases or programs. Enter this repo! This way I can just pull this repo to a new server, create some symlinks, and BAM I have what I'm used to.

Please feel free to fork it and add your own configurations, I'd love to see what people can come up with.

# Install.py

The installation script is currently a (very much) work in progress. The plan is to have it work on every macOS and Linux distro, but yeah that'll progress slowly.

# Contributing

If for some reason you like this repo, and want to contribute, I could really use help with the install.py file. I'm still very new to python (One of the reasons I'm making the script in python), so I'm sure that I'm in no way doing it the best way.

I'm always looking to better my terminal experience, so if you have some nice aliases, or maybe a way to better use nvim or tmux, please do make a pull request.
